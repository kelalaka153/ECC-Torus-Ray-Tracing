# Mapping discrete plot of an Elliptic Curve over a finite field into Torus with Ray-Tracing



This project attempted to map the discrete plot of an Elliptic Curve over a finite field into a torus. This also converts a line that represents the addition of the points. All related images can be seen [here](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/87545/18298)

[Pixel graphics](https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/581317/62865)) was not enough to reach the target. So, ray tracing is used. 

To view the result, there is a pre-compiled [HTML](https://github.com/kelalaka153/ECC-Torus-Ray-Tracing/blob/main/torus.html). The file is too big to view directly. It must be downloaded.
